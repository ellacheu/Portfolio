# My Work Portfolio

## Description 
The motivation behind creating this portfolio was to have a single source for potential employers to view a bio about myself, coding projects and other accomplishments; as well as means to contact me for further inquiries.  Aside from using it as a homepage for my resume, I built this project in order to display the skills I have learned using HTML and CSS.  It makes for a convienent quick look into skills and attributes that I can bring as a valuable potential employee.  While creating this project, I learned new methods of styling and structuring a webpage and overall, further refined my HTML and CSS skills.

## Usage
